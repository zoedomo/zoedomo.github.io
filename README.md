# Advising Software â€“ Algorithms and Data Structures

## Overview
This project is an Advising Software application developed for **CS 300: Data Structures and Algorithms**. The program manages course data, including course names, numbers, and prerequisites. It provides users the ability to load course data, display course lists, and print information about individual courses.

## Technologies Used
- C++
- File I/O
- Graph data structures
- Topological sorting
- Dynamic arrays

## Enhancements
Enhancements to this project focused on expanding its functionality and optimizing existing structures:
- Implemented a dynamic array to store motivational advising quotes
- Added topological sorting for managing course prerequisites
- Improved overall code structure and error handling
- Enhanced input validation and secure file handling

## Key Technical Competencies
- Algorithm design and optimization
- Graph data structure implementation
- Secure and efficient file I/O
- Modular, maintainable code

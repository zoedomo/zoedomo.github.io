# CS Capstone Project

## ðŸŽ“ Overview

This repository contains my final capstone project for the Computer Science program. It showcases my growth and skills across three key focus areas:

1. **Algorithms and Data Structures**
2. **Database Design and Management**
3. **Software Design and Engineering**

Each section is represented as a separate Git branch containing both the original project and its enhancements.

## ðŸš€ How to View Code

You can explore each enhancement by switching to its branch:

- On GitHub: Use the branch dropdown above the file list.
- Direct links:
  - [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/zoedomo/zoedomo.github.io/tree/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures)
  - [Databases](https://github.com/zoedomo/zoedomo.github.io/tree/Databases)
  - [Software Design and Engineering](https://github.com/zoedomo/zoedomo.github.io/tree/Software-Design-and-Engineering)

Each branch contains:
- The original version of the project
- The enhanced version (in-place or documented)
- A `README.md` with descriptions and technical highlights
